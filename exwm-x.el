;; ** What is Exwm-X

;; Exwm-X is an extension of exwm (emacs x window manager), which can
;; make exwm easier for Mouse-Control-People to use.

;; ** Feature
;; 1. Shortcuts, toolbar and other window operate buttons in mode-line.
;; 2. Move or resize a floating-window without press WIN key.
;; 3. Jump-or-exec, which will switch to an exist app instead of launch it again.

;; ** Pictures and videos
;; 1. Tilling windows

;;    [[./snapshots/tilling-window.png]]

;; 2. Floating windows

;; 3. Exwm-X videos

;; 1. Config melpa repository, please seeï¼šhttp://melpa.org/#/getting-started
;; 2. M-x package-install RET exwm-x RET

;; ** Configure

;; *** Edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file
;; You should edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file like below example:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

;; # Emacs X input method (exim) setting
;; # export XMODIFIERS=@im=exim
;; # export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
;; # export QT_IM_MODULE=xim
;; # export CLUTTER_IM_MODULE=xim

;; xhost +SI:localuser:$USER

;; exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs --eval "(if (file-exists-p \"~/.exwm.el\")(load \"~/.exwm.el\")(require 'exwm)(require 'exwm-config)(exwm-config-default)(message \"EXWM: ~/.exwm.el is not exist. use exwm fallback configure.\"))"

;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; *** Make "~/.initrc" or "~/.xsession" excutable

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; chmod a+x ~/.initrc
;; chmod a+x ~/.xsession
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; *** Edit "~/.exwm.el"
;; Add the below two lines to your emacs configure file:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (require 'exwm-x)
;; (require 'exwm-x-example) ;; Adjust this line.
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; Note: Package "exwm-x-example" is Exwm-X buildin example, user can use it to test Exwm-X's
;; features. If it doesn't suit for your need, just copy and paste its useful pieces
;; to your own exwm config :-)
