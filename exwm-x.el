;; ** What is Exwm-X

;; Exwm-X is a derivative window manager based on EXWM (emacs x window manager),
;; which focus on Mouse-Control-People.

;; ** Showcase
;; 1. Tilling windows

;;    [[./snapshots/tilling-window.png]]

;; 2. Floating windows

;;    [[./snapshots/floating-window.png]]

;; ** Feature
;; *** Appconfig
;; `exwmx-appconfig' is a database manager, which is used to record and manage
;; appconfigs (plist of application's information), when run `exwmx-appconfig',
;; a buffer will be poped up, this buffer's content is current appconfig's template,
;; user can edit the template and run `exwmx-appconfig-finish' to save your change
;; or run `exwmx-appconfig-ignore' to ignore your change.

;; All appconfig will be saved into file `exwmx-appconfig-file'.

;; By default, the following keys of appconfig will be recorded:

;; **** :command
;; Application's shell command string.

;; **** :alias
;; This key can define an application's alias, which is used by
;; `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.

;; **** :pretty-name
;; In EXWM, every application will bind an emacs buffer, if you
;; set :pretty-name for a application, the buffer will rename to
;; :pretty-name's value.

;; **** :paste-key
;; This key record the paste keybinding of application,
;; which is used by `exwmx-sendstring'.

;; **** :class
;; Record the application's class, which is used by
;; `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.

;; **** :instance
;; Record the application's instance, which is used by
;; `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.

;; **** :title
;; Record the application's title, which is used by
;; `exwmx-jump-or-exec'.


;; *** Window operate buttons.
;; Exwm-X add the following *buttons* to mode-line, user can
;; left or right click them to operate app's window:

;; 1. [X]: Delete the current application.
;; 2. [D]: Delete the current emacs window.
;; 3. [R]: Run exwm-reset.
;; 4. [F]: Toggle floating/tilling window.
;; 5. [<]: Move window border to left.
;; 6. [+]: Maximize the current window.
;; 7. [>]: Move window border to right.
;; 8. [-]: Split window horizontal.
;; 9. [|]: Split window vertical.
;; 10. [_]: minumize floating application
;; 11. [Z+]: Zoom+ floating application's window
;; 12. [Z-]: Zoom- floating application's window
;; 13. [Line 'XXXX']: toggle EXWM char-mode/line-mode

;; *** Move or resize a floating-window without press WIN key.
;; By default, EXWM use 's-<down-mouse-1>' to move a floating-window
;; and 's-<down-mouse-3>' to resize a floating-window.

;; When Exwm-X is enabled, user can drag *the apps title* showed
;; in mode-line to move a floating-window. and left or right click
;; '[Z+]' and '[Z-]' in mode-line to resize a floating-window.

;; *** Jump-or-exec
;; Only run application once. when an application's window is found,
;; jump to this window instead of launch the application again,
;; this feature need the appconfig information in `exwmx-appconfig-file'.

;; **** The simplest usage:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (exwmx-jump-or-exec "firefox")
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; **** Define an alias
;; In the following example: `exwmx-jump-or-exec' will search an appconfig
;; which :alias is "web-browser", and then run this appconfig's :command.

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (exwmx-jump-or-exec "web-browser" nil t)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; *** Dmenu
;; `exwmx-dmenu' is just dynamic menu, user can input the command in minibuffer,
;; then execute it. ivy is used to complete.

;; `exwmx-dmenu' support the following command prefix:
;; 1. ",": run command in terminal emulator, which is set by variable
;;    `exwmx-terminal-emulator', for example: command ",top" will execute
;;    a terminal emulator, then run "top" command.
;; 2. ";": run an emacs command which name is exwm:<input>,
;;    command ";firefox" will run emacs command exwm:firefox.
;; 3. "-"  split window top-to-bottom, for example:
;;    the result of command "-32" is that 3 windows on top and 2 windows in buttom.
;; 4. "|"  split window left-to-right, for example:
;;    the result of command "|32" is that 3 windows at left and 2 window at right

;; User can customize `exwmx-dmenu' by `exwmx-dmenu-prefix-setting'.

;; *** Send a string to application

;; When run `exwmx-sendstring', a buffer will be poped up and user can edit it.
;; after run command `exwmx-sendstring-finish', the content of the buffer will
;; be sent to the current application's input field.

;; `exwmx-sendstring-from-minibuffer' is a simple version of `exwmx-sendstring',
;; it use minibuffer to get user input.

;; `exwmx-sendstring-from-kill-ring' can select a string in kill-ring then send,
;; to application.

;; NOTE: if `exwmx-sendstring' can not work well with an application, you should
;; set :paste-key of this application with the help of `exwmx-appconfig'.

;; ** Install
;; 1. Config melpa repository, please seeï¼šhttp://melpa.org/#/getting-started
;; 2. M-x package-install RET exwm-x RET

;; ** Configure

;; *** Add exwm-x directory to emacs's load-path
;; Pasting the below line to "~/.emacs" is a simple way.

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/exwm-x")
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; *** Edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file
;; You should edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file like below example:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

;; # Fallback cursor
;; # xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr

;; # Keyboard repeat rate
;; # xset r rate 200 60

;; xhost +SI:localuser:$USER

;; exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs --eval '(require (quote exwmx-loader))'
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; *** Make "~/.initrc" or "~/.xsession" excutable

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; chmod a+x ~/.xsession
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; or

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; chmod a+x ~/.initrc
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; *** Edit "~/.exwm-x"
;; Add your exwm config to this file, for example:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (require 'exwm)
;; (require 'exwm-x)
;; (require 'exwmx-xfce)
;; (require 'exwmx-example)
;; (exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t v") 'exwmx:file-browser)
;; (exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t f") 'exwmx:web-browser)
;; (exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t c") 'exwmx-xfce-terminal)
;; (exwm-input-set-key (kbd "C-t C-c") 'exwmx-xfce-new-terminal)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; Note: Package "exwmx-example" is Exwm-X buildin example, user can use it to test Exwm-X's
;; features. If it doesn't suit for your need, just copy and paste its useful pieces
;; to your own exwm config :-)
